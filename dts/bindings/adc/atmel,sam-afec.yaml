        PIO pin configuration for ADTRG signal.  We expect that
        the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.  These nodes will
        have a nodelabel that matches the Atmel SoC HAL defines and
        be of the form p<port><pin><periph>_<inst>_<signal>.

        For example the I2C on SAME7x would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&pa8b_afec0_adtrg>;

    dmas:

        TX & RX dma specifiers.  Each specifier will have a phandle
        reference to the dma controller, the channel number, and peripheral
        trigger source.

        For example dmas for TX, RX would look like
           dmas = <&xdmac 22 DMA_PERID_SSC_TX>, <&xdmac 23 DMA_PERID_SSC_RX>;

        The trigger source of the ADC conversions. If a hardware
        source is selected, the hardware pheripheral will need
        to be setup separately to generate the event. This driver
        only configures the AFEC side. Please refer to the
        datasheet for more information. Also note that only the
        timer has been tested as a trigger source.

        When trigger-source 1, 2 or 3 is configured then this
        is the phandle of the timer used for triggering.
